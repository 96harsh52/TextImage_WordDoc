**OCR Assignment**

In this assignment, I evaluated three different OCR solutions for the given image: easyocr, TrOCR, and Google Vision API.

* **Easyocr:** Easyocr was able to perform OCR on the given image, but the accuracy was not satisfactory.
* **TrOCR:** TrOCR was also able to perform OCR on the given image, but it performed better on other images, such as one-line handwritten text.
* **Google Vision API:** Google Vision API performed the best on the given image, but it is a paid service.

Due to time constraints, I was unable to fine-tune the TrOCR model to improve its accuracy on the given image. However, I believe that fine-tuning the TrOCR model would be a promising approach to achieving better results.
